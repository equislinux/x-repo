# Overview

`equislinux/x-repo` is the **X package repository + web portal** repository of the X Linux
ecosystem. It has two roles that live side by side in the same repo:

1. **Binary package repository** — prebuilt X packages and the pacman database are
   committed under `public/` and served verbatim on GitHub Pages as the `[x]` pacman
   repository (and, under `public/x/`, as the native `.xp` endpoint used by `xpm`).
2. **Web portal** — a Next.js page that explains the repository (endpoints, pacman/xpm
   usage, packages and publishing flow) and is exported as a static site to the same
   GitHub Pages site.

Packages are **not** built in CI. They are built locally, committed to the repo, and the
only thing the deploy workflow does is rebuild the website and publish the whole
`public/` tree to GitHub Pages. See [web-portal.md](web-portal.md) and
[publishing.md](publishing.md).

## Role within the equislinux organization

`x-repo` is one of five repositories of the **equislinux** organization. Each repo has a
single, clear role:

| Repository | Role |
|---|---|
| `equislinux/x` | The distro. ArchISO profile, ISO/installer build and system branding. |
| `equislinux/scripts` | Provisioning payload and user setup. Ships the `x` CLI and builds the `x-scripts` package. |
| `equislinux/xpkg` | Rust package builder. Produces native `.xp` packages from `XBUILD` files. |
| `equislinux/xpm` | Rust package manager, the native counterpart of pacman. |
| `equislinux/x-repo` | **Binary package repository + web portal** (this repository). |

Two packaging paths coexist in the ecosystem:

- **PKGBUILD + makepkg** — Arch-compatible packages (`.pkg.tar.zst`) consumable by
  pacman. This is the path that currently populates the `[x]` pacman repository.
- **XBUILD + xpkg** — native packages (`.xp`) consumable by `xpm`. The tooling is
  ready but the automated native workflow is **pending** (see
  `docs/build-x-native-workflow.md`).

> **Note:** until that workflow is revived, the `.xp` files under `public/x/`
> are legacy artifacts and can lag behind the versions published in the
> pacman-facing `public/repo/` (the `[x]` repository is the supported path).

## What lives in this repository

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `packages/` | Package sources. `PKGBUILD` (pacman path) and, where present, `XBUILD` (native path) per package. |
| `public/` | Static content served on Pages. `public/repo/x86_64/` holds the `[x]` pacman repository; `public/x/x86_64/` holds the native `.xp` endpoint; the rest is website assets. |
| `build-packages.sh` | Local script to build the pacman-facing packages and regenerate the repository database. |
| `app/` | The Next.js portal source. |
| `.github/workflows/` | CI/CD. `build.yml` builds and deploys the site to GitHub Pages. |
| `docs/` | Repository documentation (this directory and `build-x-native-workflow.md`). |
